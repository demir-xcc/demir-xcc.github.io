        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>I'm a furry from Moldova 🇲🇩 that spends a lot of time around computers and stuff. I really like tech, especially older examples. I have an ASUS x451cap laptop from 2013 that I'm working on as a project, however progress is slow due to budget constraints D:</p>
        <h3>Other interests</h3>
        <p>I recently got into cubing, I wouldnt call myself a speedcuber. The only algorithm I know as of now is the beginner algorithm, my fastest time as of 15/02/2026 is ~1:24. Dont bash me for it I want to learn more advanced algorithms later on :3</p>
        <p>Besides cubing, I obviously like GAMING! I currently play a LOT of minecraft. Im not sure how many hours I've sunken into it but they were hours well spent. Other games that I play include: People Playground, TF2, Gmod, Geometry Dash, Left 4 dead 1 and 2, Terraria, modded doom, Far Cry 4 (I freaking love that game), etc. Im also experimenting with ps3 emulation, so far I've gotten legacy minecraft to run!</p>
        <p>I would also like to mention that I recently got spotify so now I've been listening to a LOT of music! I really like it and I'm open to recommendations :D</p>
